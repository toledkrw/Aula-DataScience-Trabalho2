### üìã Pre-requisites

- üêãDocker
- üíªVsCode

<br/>

>üí° Attention
>
>This project employs Docker Dev Containers, ensuring that all operations occur within containers. Therefore, it is imperative to have Docker installed on your system.
>
>It is highly recommended to utilize Visual Studio Code (VsCode), as the MS Dev Container plugin facilitates seamless integration with the development environment. Please ensure that you have Docker installed and consider installing the VsCode Dev Containers plugin for an enhanced experience.
>
>Since Docker and Dev Containers are in use, there is no need to directly install Python on your local machine. The Dev Container for this project is preconfigured to install Python, Poetry, and all necessary dependencies internally.
