## üî∞ Getting Started

This project was created to perform a data transformation and data analysis with python.

<br/>

### üíæ Tools Used

[![VsCode][VsCode]][VsCode-url]

### ü§ñ Technologies used

[![Python][Python]][Python-url]
[![Docker][Docker]][Docker-url]
[![DevContainers][DevContainers]][DevContainers-url]


### üìã Pre-requisites

- üêãDocker
- üíªVsCode

<br/>

>üí°Attention
>
> This project uses Docker Dev Containers, which means everything runs within containers and you must have docker installed. 
>
> Its highly recommended to use VsCode, as you can use the MS Dev Container plugin to ease the connection to the development environment. Please, make sure to install Docker and, as recommendation, the VsCode's Dev Containers plugin.
>
> Since we're using Docker and Dev Containers, there's no need to install Python directly in your machine. This project's Dev Container is already configured to install Python, Poetry as well as every dependency needed within itself.
> 
> Lay back and let the informagic do it's thing.
